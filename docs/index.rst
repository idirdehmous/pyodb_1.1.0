pyodb documentation 
=====================

An interface written in C/Python API to access the  `ECMWF ODB <https://example.com>`_ databases.
Its aim is to access the ODB tables/columns data and meta data using a direct SQL request embadded in python scripts.

The main source code is written in pure C and the routines handling the ODB1 format has been 'pruned' from ECMWF ODB_API bundle-0.18.1 to build only the needed libraries

Reference: The original C code has been developed by "Sami Saarinen et al" at ECMWF from 1998 --> 2008.
Some modifictions have been done to make it compatible with C/Python API ( 3.8 ---> 3.10 ).
